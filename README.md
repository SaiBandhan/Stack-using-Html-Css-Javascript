THIS GIVES AN IDEA IN WHICH WAY OUR CODE WORKS:-

HTML Structure:

Header: Contains the title "Stack" and subtitle "Visualizer".
Container: Holds the main content, including:
Container Header: Houses input fields for entering values, and buttons for pushing, popping, and resetting the stack.
Container Body: Contains two main sections:
Stack: Displays the stack elements as boxes.
Info: Provides information about the top of the stack, last pushed item, last popped item, and size of the stack.
Message Box: Displays messages related to stack operations.
CSS Styling:

Sets the overall appearance and layout of the elements, including fonts, colors, spacing, and borders.
Defines the styles for the header, container, buttons, stack, and info sections.
JavaScript Functionality:

Creates an empty array stack to represent the stack data structure.
Selects elements from the DOM using their class names for manipulation.
Defines the renderStack function to visually display the stack elements in the stackContainer.
Adds event listeners to the push, pop, and reset buttons:
Push Button:
Gets the value from the input field.
If the value is valid, pushes it onto the stack and updates the UI accordingly.
Displays a message indicating the pushed item.
Pop Button:
If the stack is not empty, pops the top element and updates the UI.
Displays a message indicating the popped item.
Reset Button:
Clears the stack and updates the UI.
Displays a message indicating the stack reset.
Calls the renderStack function initially to display an empty stack.
Explanation of Code Sections:

HTML: Defines the structure of the visualizer, including the header, input fields, buttons, stack display area, and info sections.
CSS: Styles the elements to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Implements the logic for stack operations, updates the UI, and handles user interactions.
Overall Functionality:

The user enters a value into the input field.
Clicking the "Push" button adds the value to the stack and displays it in the stack container.
Clicking the "Pop" button removes the top element from the stack and updates the display.
Clicking the "Reset" button clears the stack.
The "Info" section displays the top element, last pushed item, last popped item, and size of the stack.
The "Massage Box" shows messages about stack operations.
